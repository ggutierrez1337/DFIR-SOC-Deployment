1. Generate an elasticsearch enrollment token for Kibana
2. cd to the **/bin** directory of elasticsearch
    - The one we’re interested in is **elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token**

```powershell
cd /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin
./elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token --scope kibana
```

![Screenshot_(788)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65e6fb9a-78d9-45c8-b47b-6726fd39d9af)

![Screenshot_(789)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46a60642-aa89-46a7-988c-a3a1fe3def07)

1. Save the enrollment token as it will be used for later use
2. Under firewall rules, allow access from the Public IP and Port. Make sure to do it within the Ubuntu Server as well

```powershell
ufw allow 5601
```

1. Access the Kibana instance by inputting in the following in the URL - **Server_IP:5601** and paste the enrollment token generated from earlier

![Screenshot_(791)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f783ede-32be-4133-a4cc-94cb48529122)

1. Back in the server instance, cd to **/bin** of Kibana. The one of interest is **kibana-verification-code.** A verification code will then be generated for Kibana

```powershell
cd /usr/share/kibana/bin/
./kibana-verfication-code
```

# Fleet Server

Fleet Server is **a component of the Elastic Stack used to centrally manage Elastic Agents**. It's launched as part of an Elastic Agent on a host intended to act as a server

Agents provide a **unified** way to add monitoring for logs, metrics, and other types of data

There are **two types** of agents

- Standalone
- Fleet managed

## Elastic Agent and Fleet Server Setup

1. Deploy an Ubuntu 22.04 server with at least 1 CPU, 4GB RAM, and 55GB of Storage
2. Make sure the ELK Server is running and in the interface of the hamburger menu select, **Fleet** under **Management** tab

![Screenshot_(800)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4fcfb5cb-2eda-4e7c-a6a1-63369ca2ddda)

1. Select **Add Fleet Server** and choose **Quick Start** and input the name/IP of the fleet server created

![Screenshot_(801)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e697526-5eb7-4e60-a0d9-5e2fe12b02c1)

1. In the firewall for DFIR-SOC, allow all ports to be accessed by the Fleet Server by inputting the custom IP
2. SSH into the ELK Server and allow port 9200 because that is the port for elasticsearch
    - This is because elasticsearch listens on port 9200 and the fleet server needs to be able to access to the ELK Server

```powershell
ufw allow 9200
```

1. SSH into the Fleet Server instance and run the command provided by elasticsearch

```powershell
curl -L -O https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/beats/elastic-agent/elastic-agent-8.17.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
tar xzvf elastic-agent-8.17.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
cd elastic-agent-8.17.0-linux-x86_64
sudo ./elastic-agent install \
  --fleet-server-es=https://104.207.142.125:9200 \
  --fleet-server-service-token=AAEAAWVsYXN0aWMvZmxlZXQtc2VydmVyL3Rva2VuLTE3MzU1MTQ2MjAzMTE6UW1xMnNrN1RTTnVtV01VNHNxUEY0QQ \
  --fleet-server-policy=fleet-server-policy \
  --fleet-server-es-ca-trusted-fingerprint=4351dc83fa6f37520c43687c24a43fef6c4170cdec972fa9f3f2640773d3a8f6 \
  --fleet-server-port=8220
```

1. If done correctly, on the elasticsearch site, it should prompt **Fleet Server Connected**

![Screenshot_(802)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae7f9c4a-e544-42c1-af32-c481e7db51f3)

1. Continue the enrollment and specify the hosts that should be monitored. Since we want to monitor the Windows Server, input a policy name and select the agent type that will be installed **Windows**

![Screenshot (803).png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/246692bd-cf92-4f91-8b4e-6d4c15c8bf7a/f9fa8d77-ae96-466c-947c-2aa7f6d01a76/Screenshot_(803).png)

1. In the Fleet Server run the following command to allow the firewall to receive access from the port it runs on 8220  and 443

```powershell
ufw allow 8220
ufw allow 443
```

1. In elasticsearch under Manage → Fleet change the port connection from 443 to 8220 since Fleet runs on 8220

![Screenshot (805).png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/246692bd-cf92-4f91-8b4e-6d4c15c8bf7a/301c92cb-09bb-44af-8fb1-6a43a3ab01c2/Screenshot_(805).png)

![Screenshot (806).png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/246692bd-cf92-4f91-8b4e-6d4c15c8bf7a/1d719e4f-669a-471d-a267-b83778148c3e/Screenshot_(806).png)

1. Connect to the Windows Server created earlier and run PowerShell as Admin. Input the command provided by elasticsearch. Ensure to change the port from 443 to 8220
    - At the end of the command add **—insecure** because a self signed certificate will be presented

```powershell
$ProgressPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/beats/elastic-agent/elastic-agent-8.17.0-windows-x86_64.zip -OutFile elastic-agent-8.17.0-windows-x86_64.zip 
Expand-Archive .\elastic-agent-8.17.0-windows-x86_64.zip -DestinationPath .
cd elastic-agent-8.17.0-windows-x86_64
.\elastic-agent.exe install --url=https://45.76.22.179:**8220** --enrollment-token=WXhySEZKUUJDbDgzWE9GTWVHWW86cy1uRkdRelpSeVNPejljMll1WnZ3UQ== **--insecure**
```

1. SSH into the server and cd to the directory containing the **auth.log** 
    - This will contain authentication attempts

```powershell
cd /var/log
```

![Screenshot (828).png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/246692bd-cf92-4f91-8b4e-6d4c15c8bf7a/ab496c8e-0ca4-4237-b2a2-2376bb6c7a88/Screenshot_(828).png)

1. Failed passwords can be filtered by running the following 
    - **cut** helps select data from a particular column specified by a delimiter
    - The following when checking for root will paste all the IPs of the those that tried to SSH into the SSH Server

```powershell
grep -i failed auth.log
grep -i failed auth.log | grep -i root | cut -d ' ' -f 9
```

## Elastic Agent Installation on SSH Server
